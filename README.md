## Running

```
./gradlew bootRun
```

The application is available available at base URL: http://localhost:8080. To test a specific endpoint, for example, fetching a single Todo, use the URL: http://localhost:8080/todos/1

### `build`

```
./gradlew build
```

The command produces build artifacts in the `./build` directory. The JAR file is created in `./build/libs`. For example, `todo-ws-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`.

You can run the executable JAR file with (supply the name of your JAR file):

```
java -jar build/libs/todo-ws-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

```
./gradlew clean
