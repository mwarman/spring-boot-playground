The application is available available at base URL: http://localhost:8080. To test a specific endpoint, for example, fetching a single Todo, use the URL: http://localhost:8080/api/todos/1

### `bootJar`

Assembles an executable jar archive containing the main classes and their dependencies.

```
./gradlew bootJar
```

The command produces build artifacts in the `./build` directory. The JAR file is created in `./build/libs`. For example, `todo-ws-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`.
